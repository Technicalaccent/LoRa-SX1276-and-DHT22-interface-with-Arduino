	LoRa SX1276 and DHT22 interface with Arduino


1) What is LoRa modulation?

-> LoRa is a wireless modulation technique derived from Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS) technology. It encodes information on radio waves using chirp pulses - similar to the way dolphins and bats communicate! LoRa modulated transmission is robust against disturbances and can be received across great distances.

2) How far can LoRa transmit?

-> The name, LoRa, is a reference to the extremely long-range data links that this technology enables. Created by Semtech to standardize LPWANs, LoRa provides for long-range communications: up to three miles (five kilometers) in urban areas, and up to 10 miles (15 kilometers) or more in rural areas (line of sight).

3) Is LoRa legal in India?

-> So in reality a major portion of the 868 MHz LoRa frequency channels are in the license-free 865 MHz â€“ 867 MHz band in India. Seven out of the eight channels are in the license-free band in India.

4) Can LoRa work without an antenna?

-> No, the antenna is tuned to a specific range of frequencies, (WiFi is 2.4Ghz or 5Ghz,LoRa is a number of frequencies 166Mhz-915Mhz) using the wrong antenna means it will not be able to pick up (or transmit) signals in the right frequency range.
